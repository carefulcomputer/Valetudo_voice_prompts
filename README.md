# Valetudo Voice Prompts

Voice prompts for [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo) open source software. These prompts are similar to Dreame vacuum so may not work for other devices due to different filenames/prompts. Feel free to fork and use for other vacuums.

Other voice prompts will be added in future. First to kick off repo is Terminator voice (T2 folder)

Contributions are welcome. 
Here is list of prompts compiled by @ccoors
