# valetudo_voice_prompts

Voice prompts for Valetudo open source software. These prompts are similar to Dreame vacuum so may not work for other devices due to different filenames/prompts. Feel free to fork and use for other vacuums.

Other voice prompts will be added in future. First to kick off repo is Terminator voice (T2 folder)

License: Can use for personal purposes. No commerical use.
